This repository contains a simple Java program that reverses a string using a stack data structure. It demonstrates the use of the `java.util.Stack` class for character-level manipulation.

## Description

The program pushes each character of the input string onto a stack and pops them to build the reversed string, showcasing the LIFO (Last In First Out) behavior of stacks.
